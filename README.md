# Folio

**Social investing for anyone, anywhere: US stocks, pre-IPO companies, and index funds on Solana.**

Folio lets anyone in the world buy tokenized US stocks, pre-IPO companies, and index funds. 

You don't need a brokerage account, a minimum balance, or to live in a particular country. 

Users sign in with Google and can start investing in seconds from their own Solana wallet.

> Built for the [Solana Stocklana Hackathon](https://hackathons.solana.com/hackathons/stocklana).

## Why Folio

- **Investing in US Stocks is hard:** Most of the world can't open a US brokerage account, Folio needs only a Google login.
- **Private markets are closed:** Pre-IPO companies like OpenAI, SpaceX, and Anthropic have mostly been open only to accredited investors and VCs.
- **Investing is hard:** Traditional apps hide what everyone else is doing. 

On Folio, investing is social, and every position can be verified on-chain.

Our mission: **make tokenized assets accessible to anyone, anywhere, in one click.**

### Onboarding

The first-run flow asks four questions, which build the user's investor profile:

1. **What to own**: interests (US stocks, pre-IPO, funds)
2. **Starting size**: how much capital to start with
3. **Risk behavior**: how comfortable the user is with risk
4. **Holding period**: time horizon

```

- **Wallet per user:** At sign-up, the backend creates a Privy user linked to the Google account and provisions a dedicated **Solana wallet** for that user, Assets settle into that wallet, never into a pooled Folio account.
- **Routing, not issuing.** Folio doesn't issue any exposure itself, It aggregates liquidity venues and routes each order:
  - **US stocks**: tokenized equities from **xStocks** (SPL / Token-2022 tokens on Solana).
  - **Pre-IPO**: tokenized exposure to private companies from **PreStocks**.
  - Trades are executed as **USDC ⇄ asset swaps** on Solana, and the resulting tokens land in the user's wallet.
- **Index funds** are baskets of tokenized constituents. Buying a fund executes a swap for each constituent in proportion.
- **Recurring buys** are stored as schedules and executed by the same routing layer at the chosen frequency.
- **Verifiable by design.** Balances are read directly from chain (SOL, SPL, and Token-2022 accounts), so positions, the social feed, and the leaderboard reflect real on-chain activity.
- **Pricing.** A separate service keeps live prices (every 5 minutes) and daily open prices in Postgres from the xStocks and PreStocks APIs, Charts come from Jupiter's data API.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL
- A [Privy](https://privy.io) app with server wallets enabled and an authorization key
- A Solana mainnet RPC URL
- Google OAuth client IDs (web and iOS)
- Xcode and/or Android Studio to run the app

### 1. Backend: user-management-service

```bash
cd user-management-service
npm install
```

Create `user-management-service/.env`:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/folio
PORT=5000
RPC_URL=https://your-solana-mainnet-rpc
PRIVY_APP_ID=...
PRIVY_APP_SECRET=...
PRIVY_AUTH_KEY=...
PRIVY_AUTH_ADDRESS=...
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
```

```bash
npx prisma migrate deploy
npx prisma generate
npm run dev
```

### 2. Backend: pricing-service

```bash
cd pricing-service
npm install
echo "DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/folio" > .env
npx prisma generate
npm run dev
```

You can also run both services with Docker:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### 3. Mobile app

```bash
cd app
npm install
```

Create `app/.env`:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://<your-local-ip>:5000/api
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID=...
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID=...
```

Google Sign-In uses native modules, so run a development build instead of Expo Go:

```bash
npm run ios
```

```bash
npm run android
```
